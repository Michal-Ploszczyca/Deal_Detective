# Deal_Detective


Deal Detective is an evolving project dedicated to tracking and analyzing smartphone prices from various online retailers. Currently, it focuses on the iPhone 14 series, but it's designed with adaptability in mind. As newer models like the iPhone 15 emerge, the project will transition to accommodate the latest in the market.

Current Capabilities:

-Scans multiple online platforms to fetch real-time prices of the iPhone 14 series.
-Stores the extracted smartphone names and prices for further analysis.
-Designed with a modular approach, making it easier to adapt for other smartphone models in the future.

Future Roadmap:

-Transition and expand the scanning capability to newer iPhone models, such as iPhone 15.
-Integrate a feature to export the gathered data to Excel for in-depth analysis.
-Eventually, set up a system to store the data in a database, allowing for historical price tracking and trend analysis.
-Deal Detective is in active development. I aim to make it a robust tool that provides valuable insights for consumers and analysts alike. Contributions and suggestions are always welcome!
